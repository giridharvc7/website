I'm a Senior Product Manager at **[Postman](https://www.postman.com)**, where I work on the API client, making multi-protocol testing more powerful for developers. But _"Product manager"_ is just the job title. The more honest description is that I like building and selling things.

I started my career at **[Zoho](https://www.zoho.com)** as an iOS developer, and over time I wore every hat I could find. Marketing, pre-sales, even closing our first sale for **[Catalyst](https://www.zoho.com/catalyst/)**, a product I helped build from scratch. That range stuck with me. At work now, it's developer tools. On my own time, it's small apps that solve problems I keep having. I love scratching my own itch. Some of those live [here](/website/projects).

I'm vegetarian and unreasonably into food. I cook across cuisines, chase authentic local meals when I travel, and lately I've been on a high-protein kick since I started lifting. When I travel, the first place i visit is the local markets or a Supermarket. What a city puts on its shelves tells you more than what it puts in its touristy spots. I always come home with a bag of things I can't find in Chennai.

I game in my free time - In a past life I played Call of Duty competitively. Now I own four consoles and barely turn any of them on.

This site is where I [write](/website/writing) about product work, share travel stories and photos, and keep a record of [things I've made](/website/projects). Mostly Human written, sometimes LLM edited.
